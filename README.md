## Introduction 
Surveillance ensures safety and security, an integral part of every individual‚Äôs life, Thus Cameras are installed everywhere. But still news of crime resonates throughout the year. Who is looking at those footage prior to an incident? They appear to have become just an evidence collecting source. 
 
### üî≠ &nbsp; About this Project

Through this project, we aim to convert a **CCTV surveillance from an evidence collection device to a crime prevention and detection tool to ensure safety and security**.
The system will detect and simultaneously alert any suspicious activity captured by the camera through a notification which will be sent to the concerned authority. The technologies encompasses domains of Computer Vision and Deep Learning models like **CNN, R-CNN, LSTM**. The dataset consists of 2000+ videos scraped off internet and categorized into ***violent and non-violent*** activities.

###  ‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp; Current Progress
We tried and tested various architectures for this project. A brief summary and stats for each is given below:
1. **Customised CNN Model**: The customised CNN model with optimised parameters performed well on the training and sufficiently good in the test dataset. The architecture is currently being used by the website and test.ipynb file.

    - Accuracy on training: 0.7990
    - Loss on training: 0.4292
    - Val_loss: 0.7605
    - Val_accuracy: 0.6680
    - Optimizer: Adam
    - Loss: BinaryCrossEntropy
    - Epochs: 50
    - steps_per_epoch: 50

### ‚öôÔ∏è &nbsp; Ultimate Objective
The model uses the technique of Multiple Object Detection with Localization tracking the movement of people and then categorizing it into violent or non-violent behavior. Our proposed solution will ensure Public Safety and security without any human toil with an instant alert to the concerned authorities. With our deep learning model integrated with your application, and personalised user login which detects and sends the notifications in real time to the concerned authority in case any suspicious activity is detected. We aim to curb the constant rise of criminal activities, their unexpectedness, and scope of harm.
