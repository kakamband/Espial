## Introduction 

**Surveillance** is an integral part of security and control. The job requires extended periods of looking into multiple video footages for an undesirable incident or evidence following the incident, which proves to be highly inefficient considering the massive amount of footages. This manual task provides evidence in court but is rarely used to prevent ***crime or react to it in real-time***.
